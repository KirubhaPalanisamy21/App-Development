    <p className="faq-heading">Can I add a PowerPoint to Brainitz</p>
    <div className="faq-arrow" />
    <p className="faq-text">
      Yes, you can add a PowerPoint to Brainitz. The easiest way is to record
      your PowerPoint presentation using a screen capture program like
      www.screencast-o-matic.com You can view our tutorial on how to do this
      here. <br />
      <br />
      This will allow you to record your PowerPoint as a video with your voice
      describing the slides. You will then be able to upload the video on
      Brainitz and create an interactive video lesson. If you have any more
      questions, please feel free to submit a request!

      Did my student really get logged out and lose their progress?
    </p>
    <div className="faq-arrow" />
    <p className="faq-text">
      If a student does not answer a question in 5 minutes after it pops up the
      student will be ‘timed out’ and they will lose their progress from the
      last previously answered question <br />
      <br />
      This feature is built in to discourage students from playing a video
      lesson and walking away. Students must stay engaged with the video lesson
      to avoid being timed out. If you have more questions, please feel free to
      submit a request!
